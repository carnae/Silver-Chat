that an irp be completed iocompleterequest, but the packet has already been completed. this is a tough bug to find because the easiest case, a driver actually attempted to complete its own packet twice, is generally not what happened. rather, two separate drivers each believe that they own the packet, and each attempts to complete it. the first actually works, and the second fails. tracking down which drivers in the system actually did this is difficult, generally because the trails of the first driver have been covered by the second. however, the driver stack for the current request can

other windows laptops, i meant to get around fixing this taking this to a shop but never did. i should mention that it fell off a recliner, on it's corner, about a 4 foot drop. the lan connection port is dent a bit. there is a dent in the middle of the port but i can still squeeze the cable in and i'm sure i could fix the dent a little. so up until this point, i thought the hdd was damaged because of bad sectors from all the crashing and rebooting. i ran so many tests, for so long, trying to repair the hdd but it came back clean every time. i tried other 3rd party apps a while back, same results. i wanted to swap out the hdd to test a hdd that i knew for sure wasn't damaged and i finally did it last week. i got a 525 gb crucial m2 ssd. i updated the os before the ssd dwap and after. i wiped the hdd clean before that and it still froze up. i have no clue what to do now. i have a decent mbp, all the drivers are up to date, like the os, new ssd and still it crashes every 20 minutes or so. probably longer if i just leave it idle but that's not good enough. i've spent hours researching but replacing the hdd to the ssd should've resolved my issues. i guess i need to replace the mobo because it's damaged? is that even worth it at this point? any help would be much appreciated, i'm exhausted and on the verge of taking it to geeksquad but i really don't want to pay a few hundred when the mbp isn't worth too much now anyway. can someone decode these errors? these are the last two crash reports: 1. tue may 1 19:39:45 2018 panic report paniccpu 2 caller 0xffffff7f8a99b9cf: gpu

300400 2. what is the size of the notebook that you are considering? 14 15.6 3. what screen resolution do you want? doesn't matter particularly. not less than 1366768 4. do you need a portable or desktop replacement laptop? not sure what this means exactly. i will mainly be using it at home, but may travel with it occasionally too. 5. how much battery life do you need? the bigger the better. this is quite an important feature for me, as we don't have much electricity during the day where i am. still, my current laptop has an hour at good times and 15 minutes when it wants to be temperamental, so anything would be an improvement. i'm not sure if i'll find something comparable to the acer aspire e15 mentioned above with its crazy longlife battery, but if there is something comparable to it, that would be great. 6. do you want to play games with your laptop? if so then please list the games that you want to with the settings that you want for these games. low,medium or high? not too important to me. i play world of tanks, but have been playing it on a 2nd gen pentium without a dedicated gpu, so again, just about anything would be an improvement on that. my friend's acer aspire e15 has done a decent job dealing with everything i've thrown at it. 7. what other tasks do you want to do with your laptop? photovideo editing, etc. possibly a bit of photovideoaudio editing, but not my primary concern. 8. how much storage hard drive capacity do you need? hard to say. i don't use google docs or any of that stuff due to sketchy internet connectivity, so i think 500 gb is a minimum. i have a 500 gb hdd in my old laptop which i could use on top of an ssd, but i plan to sell the old laptop, so taking the hdd out would make it that much more difficult. i am almost certainly looking at a computer with both an m.2 and 2.5 bay so that i can have both an ssd and hdd running together. 9. if you are considering specific sites to buy from, please post their links. amazon.com. there may be other options, but i'd need to check about the possibility of ordering through them, as i'll be ordering through a company who ships stuff from the states to africa. 10. how long do you want to keep your laptop? ha! as long as possible! i've got more than 8 years of life out of the secondhand hp probook 6450b, and am still using it, so i'm not particularly worried about my computer becoming obsolete. 11. what kind of optical drive do you need? dvd romwriter,bluray romwriter,etc ? they're always nice to have, but not necessary. 12. please tell us about the brands that you prefer to buy from them and the brands that you don't like and explain the reasons. no preference so long as the computer is decent. i haven't seen anyone recommend any knockoff brands on tomshardware yet, so i think i'm good with anything you would advise me to get. 13. what country do you live in? west africa for now, but i'll be ordering from the states. 14. please tell us any additional information if needed. i think 4 gb ram is too little for me. i am looking more at 6gb8gb. also would like at least an intel i3 or ryzen 3 as far as cpu is concerned. some cheap ram i found if i get a laptop that can add additional ram: only 1 left though i'm not sure how the acer aspire e15 e5576392h managed to pack so much into their computer at such a cheap price. the battery is awesome, it has a dvd drive, lots of ports, a solid cpu, slots for both m2 and 2.5 drives, etc. a steal of a buy at the price we got it for. if i can find something comparable to it, that would be awesome. this is the best bet i've come across so far: acer aspire 5 the ssd size is really poor, and i'll definitely need to use another drive with it, i could upgrade the ram fairly cheaply to 8 gb. battery life isn't as awesome as the e15, but still good. do you think i can do better than this, though?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "for the price, it is really difficult. you are really looking at the ryzen 3 and ryzen 5 if you are lucky apu's, as they have the bestintegrated graphics for the price. i managed to find a laptop that has a ryzen 5 apu on amazon.com, but i am not totally certain around the shipping costs as it is not mentioned until checkout: lenovo ideapad 330s ryzen 5 2500u vega 8 graphics 8gb ram ddr4 memory 4gb's soldered 4gb's in the dim slot 256gb nvme ssd 15.6 1920 x 1080 1080p display realistic average battery life 2 to 3 hours according to reviews info: it is the best laptop for the price with pretty decent hardware. for the price, the battery life isn't going to be amazing, around 2 hours most..."}]}
