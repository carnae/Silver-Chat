sometimes, seemingly at random, websites will be painfully slow to load or respond after a click. and not any particular one, it could be any site. youtube, gmail, my school website, a browser search, shopping, gaming will lag out at times, file downloads will fail, etc. sometimes it's clear my connection will just hang. it lasts for a few seconds, then returns to lightspeed. i think i've ensured my chipset drivers, lan drivers, and windows are up to date. although, i can't really tell for the lan drivers, the intel update utility says it's updated with a version from 2018. it's possible that really is the newest version... it's quite an old board, but i'm unsure. on the board oem page, the lan driver downloads some tool called intel proset adapter config utility. when i run the intel proset adapter config utility, sometimes it says i have no supported adapter. other times, it loads fine and it will pass all the connectionhardware tests. other times, it crashes the computer when i run the hardware test. this issue does not exist when connected to wifi. any guesses? this issue did not happen before i installed windows on the new ssd on same system. spoiler: detailed system
